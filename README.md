This program allows the M5Cardputer to control a TEA5767 FM receiver over I2C, providing on-screen frequency display, signal strength, and mono/stereo indicators. The user can navigate through scanned stations, switch to saved stations, and fine-tune the frequency. Output of the TEA5767 radio module can be sent to a powered/amplified speaker or headphones. Saved stations are kept in a file on the SD card called RadioSta.TXT. The file is required for intended operations.

Essentials:
Modify your Radio preferences in the INO file and stations in the RadioSta.Txt file. Compile the INO file & load directly or to a Bin & use Launcher on Cardputer. Copy RadioSta.txt to the root directory of the SD card.
